This golang program allows for the decoding tapes produced in the LTFS version object format (LTFS-VOF). 

The program will read each tape extract its contents and then writes to a 3rd party S3 provided by the user. 

Prior to starting the progrom the user should create the S3 target buckets that correspond to the S3 buckets that were written to the tapes.

These buckets need to have identical names along with being setup with the identical versioning or non-versioning configuration. 
Secret and access keys required for the target backets should be set as environment variables.  

The LTFS-VOF specification defines two types of files;  meta-data files with a .ver suffix and data files with  a .blk suffix.
