This golang program allows for the decoding of tapes produced in the LTFS version object format (LTFS-VOF). These are tapes that have been written by the Spectralogic Vail software in conjunction with BlackPearl tape mangement. There are several steps a customer needs to perform to run the program.

Physical Equipment Setup

- A Tape Library with a logical or physical partition that can be used exclusively for this decoding operation.
- The tape library partition should contain all cartridges to be decoded.
- The tape library partition should have one or more tape drives, the program will use tape drives in parallel to speed up the decoding process.  
- A server that has a physical connection to the tape library partition and all of its tape drives.

Software Setup
- This program should be installed and compiled on the server.
- A mount point should be made on the server for each drive that is in the library partition 

$ sudo mkdir /ltfs0
$ sudo mkdir /ltfs1
etc.

- The file config.json should be copied over to another file name and its entries edited based on the tape library partition and drives.
